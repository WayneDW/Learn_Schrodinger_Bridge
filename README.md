# Learn_Schrodinger_Bridge
Learn other's code for practice

I am learning simulations based on this paper: "Likelihood Training of Schr√∂dinger Bridge using Forward-Backward SDEs Theory (SB-FBSDE)".

You can check the office code link [here](https://github.com/ghliu/SB-FBSDE)


### Next Step

Figure out how to how to load pretrain models.
